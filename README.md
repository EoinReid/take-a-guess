# Take a guess!
Take a guess! is a game I created using HTML, CSS & JavaScript that randomly generators a number between 1 and 20 and users have to try and guess the number! 
Be careful though, as every wrong guess lowers your score and if you go to 0, it's game over!
So you have to pay attention to the prompt that tells you if your guess was too high, or too low if you want to survive and get a nice new highscore!
